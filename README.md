What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  Implementing different data structures in order to perform specific tasks.  For the the final advising program, we had to select the most appropriate data structure and write code that would print out a list of courses in alphabetical order. For this software requirements, I selectec to use a vector to print out the list of courses.  Since the list of courses was given to us, and is not going to be changed, a vector would be a good selection.l 
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem by first making sure that I understood all the was required for the program.  Knowing exactly what needs to happen within the code is a crutial aspect in planning and writing code.  Next, I had to ensure that I knew about the different data structres and which would be the most benefical for the task at hand. There were other options that could have worked as well, like a Binary Search Tree or Hash Table, but I think that a vector was a good option for storing and printing the list of courses. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Utilizing different resources was a helpfult way to overcome any challenged that I encountered when working on this program. Stackoverflow and Reddit are both resources that I like to use when working on something unfamiliar.   YouTube also has some great tutorials on data structures and getting a better understanding for which data structure would be the most effective. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  Understanding more about data structures and how important they are to writing algorithms has improved the way I approach a problem, where before, I might not have been as focused on which data structure to utilize.  Data is a primiary component on programming and computers in general.  Not only knowing about data structures but also how to write effective algoriths to support the software requirements is important.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable has become more of a focus since taking this course.  I have looked at some of the things I coded in the past, and it might not be as readable to others as it is was to me.  Writing code that someone else can easily read and understand, as well as maintain, is a very important practice to be a great software engineer.  Not just writing code that someone else cannot easily understand.  Also, I have learned how helpful it can be to implement comment codes, even if they are obvious.  It helped me with organziation and if I needed to find something quickly withtout having to read and skim through more code than I needed to.
